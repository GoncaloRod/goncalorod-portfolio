            Space Fighters is a multiplayer free-for-all spaceship fighting game inspired by Elite Dangerous' Arenas.
          </p>

          <p>
            This game was made for a course on networking for games and one of the requirements was that I needed to 
            have some sort of matchmaking system.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the networking library, I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror" target="_blank">Mirror</a> 
            that is originally based on old Unity UNet and fixes most the bugs and instabilities of UNet. Also Mirror has 
            a very good community and documentation, which was very important since it was my first time making a multiplayer 
            game.
          </p>

        <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
          <p>
            For the matchmaking system I went with a Server List that would list all the dedicated servers hosted officially or by 
            players, using the provided dedicated server executable.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Due to time limitations I was not able to implement my own server list service so I used a community made project called 
            <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/NodeListServer" target="_blank">NodeListServer</a>. This is obviously not the ideal 
            solution because, first because I ran into some bugs, like servers remaining in the list after being shout down or after a crash 
            (which happens a lot during the development process), and second it's a generic project designed to work with as many games as 
            possible so a specific solution designed only with my game in mind would be a bit more efficient and optimized.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            If all you want is to play with a friend locally, you have the option to host a lobby inside the game and to directly connect to 
            a given address and port.

          <p>
            By default lobbies allow for a maximum of 10 players and require a minimum of 2 players to start the match. These 
            settings can be changed using environment variables, if you are hosting a lobby using the dedicated server binary, 
            along side many other settings, like the lobby name, the game duration or even the server port (if you wish to 
            host multiple instances in one machine).
