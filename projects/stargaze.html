            Stargaze is a multiplayer co-op puzzle game. One player will play as engineer and the other as navigator. 
            You play as crew members of a ship that broke down and you are now stranded in space. 
            You were unable to join the rest of the crew and escape so, in order to return home, 
            you need to work together to repair the ship.

            This game as developed by a group of 4 for the final project of my degree.

            In this project I was responsible for all the <a href="#networking">networking</a> tasks and also some 
            gameplay aspects like the <a href="#character-controller">character controller</a>, 
            <a href="#interactable-terminals">interactable  terminals</a> and the

            For this game, we didn't want to deal with the costs of hosting and maintaining servers
            so we opted for a Pear to Pear approach.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For easier match making we used Steamworks to allow the players to create lobbies and invite
            their friends to play using Steam. Players also have an option to create public lobbies and
            allow random players to join them if they wish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I would be the one responsible for implementing all the multiplayer features in the 
            game I chose <a href="https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror" target="_blank">Mirror</a> as networking 
            library, because I was already familiar with it from previous projects, and chose 
            <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks" target="_blank">Facepunch.Steamworks</a> 
            to integrate Steamworks into our project.

            One of this game's puzzles required the gravity of the players to be turned off so I had to implement 
            both a grounded and a zero-g character controller and a way to switch between them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I accomplished this by implementing both independently of each other and enabling or disabling them
            according to the gravity state.

            This was a suggestion of mine to the Game Designers, because I see this type of terminals in
            games like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen, and since I was the one that suggested it
            I would also be the one responsible for their implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was able to do this by rendering a canvas to a render target and using the render target
            as a texture for the screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sadly, I was not able implement mouse for navigating the terminal UI so the player is forced 
            to use the arrow keys for that.
