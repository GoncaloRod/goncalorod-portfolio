            Stargaze is a multiplayer co-op puzzle game. One player will play as engineer and the other as navigator. 
            You play as crew members of a ship that broke down and you are now stranded in space. 
            You were unable to join the rest of the crew and escape so, in order to return home, 
            you need to work together to repair the ship.

            For this game, we didn't want to deal with the costs of hosting and maintaining servers
            so we opted for a Pear to Pear approach.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For easier match making we used Steamworks to allow the players to create lobbies and invite
            their friends to play using Steam. Players also have an option to create public lobbies and
            allow random players to join them if they wish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I would be the one responsible for implementing all the multiplayer features in the 
            game I chose <a href="https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror" target="_blank">Mirror</a> as networking 
            library, because I was already familiar with it from previous projects, and chose 
            <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks" target="_blank">Facepunch.Steamworks</a> 
            to integrate Steamworks into our project.

            One of this game's puzzles required the gravity of the players to be turned off so I had to implement 
            both a grounded and a zero-g character controller and a way to switch between them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I accomplished this by implementing both independently of each other and enabling or disabling them
            according to the gravity state.

            This was a suggestion of mine to the Game Designers, because I see this type of terminals in
            games like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen, and since I was the one that suggested it
            I would also be the one responsible for their implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was able to do this by rendering a canvas to a render target and using the render target
            as a texture for the screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sadly, I was not able implement mouse for navigating the terminal UI so the player is forced 
            to use the arrow keys for that.
          </p>

          <p>
            This concept could also be applied in a non interactable object, like a car dashboard that 
            displays the car's speed and RPMs for example.

            This puzzle consists of one player having access to the mining drone scanner, where he is able to
            see where the minable resources are around the ship, and the other player is able to move the drone
            around and gather the resources. The resources are necessary for the next puzzle to fabricate the fuel
            for the ship. The player with the drone scanner needs to tell the player with the controls where to 
            move the drone so they can gather all the resources needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resources are placed in a random position to prevent the players from memorizing the placement
            from the previous gameplays.
          </p>

          <p>
            To implement this I stored all the data in a centralized object in the server for easier syncing around 
            better security.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scanning station, then reads the data in that object and displays in on screen, but only when 
            there's a change like a resource that was gathered or the drone position changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile the drone control station just sends a command to the server whenever the player wants 
            to move the drone or gather a resource. All the logic behind that  is handled by the server, again 
            for security reasons.
